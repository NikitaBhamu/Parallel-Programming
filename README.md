# Parallel-Programming
This repository contains two assignments of the course Paralle-Programming.<br /><br />
Assignment 1 :- This assignment is about parallelising the sum of first N natural numbers using two different strategies and then analysing their performance.<br /><br />
-> Strategy 0 is the approach in which we calculate the partial sums of the n/p  partitions and then add those partial sums sequentially.<br />
-> Strategy 1 is the approach in which a downward heap is formed if we draw the steps.<br /><br />
Assignment 2 :- This assignment is about parallelising the Crout matrix decomposition using four different strategies and then analysing their performance.<br /><br />
